Why should you care about computer science?
        (Lecture overview)
    1.  Why technology is powerful, and why computers are especially powerful
    2.  How to make money knowing these things
The actual computer science:
    A.  What's an Algorithm?
        1.  Why they're powerful
            A)  Algorithms are basically education.  You teach the computer to do something, then it becomes a nice little worker bee
        2.  Formally, "an unambiguous set of instructions"
        3.  Self-driving car code
    B.  Recursion
        1.  What is recursion?
            A)  Defining something in terms of itself
            B)  In mathematics, called "induction"
        2.  Factorial is a good use of recursion
        3.  Fibonacci is a bad  use of recursion
            A)  Why?
                1)  I bet you can remember
                2)  This is key to understanding recursion
    C.  Arc Lisp
        1.  Functions
        2.  Macros

    1.  Data structures concepts

        B.  The dumbed-down version is in "Cracking the Coding Interview"
            1)  I won't literally tell you where to pirate this, but it's available online
            2)  This book is also good because it teaches you how to get a job.  Interviewing is a pain, and this helps you through the process
    2.  Arc Lisp

        D.  Why learn Arc instead of some other language?
